Feature: Group Service tests

  Scenario: Count groups in a blank database
  The default group table must be empty.

    When I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    When I count the group entries in the database
    Then I count 0
    And I logout

  Scenario: Regular group in root scope
  Create a regular group entry. The newly created entry must match the
  creator parameters.

    When I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    When I configure the group service

      | boolean | infiniteChildEntities  | true  | 1       | 1        |
      | integer | maxNumberChildEntities | 5     | 1       | 1        |
    Given I create the group
      | scope | name        |
      | 1     | test_name_1 |
    Then A group was created
    And The group matches the creator
    And I logout
